\section{The Torus Graph(s)}
The \textit{Torus Graph} $T_{j,k}$ is a $j \times k$ grid with extra edges connecting the leftmost and rightmost vertex in each row as well as the top and bottom vertices of each column.

\begin{question}
    Prove that for any pair of vertices $a,b \in V_{T_{j,k}}$, there exists an isomorphism $f:T_{j,k} \to T_{j,k}$ such that $f(a) = b$.
\end{question}

\begin{proof}
    Consider a vertex $a \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} T_{j,k}$ in the form
    $(m,n)$ where $m \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} (0, 1, ... j-1)$ and $n \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} (0, 1, ... k-1)$. \\

    Its four adjacent vertices in the Torus graph would be :
    \begin{align*}
        ((m+1)\%j, n) \\
        ((m-1)\%j, n) \\
        (m, (n+1)\%k) \\
        (m, (n-1)\%k) \\
    \end{align*}

    Consider any other vertex $b \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} T_{j,k}$ in the form $((m+x) \% j,(n+y) \% k)$. Changing $x$ and $y$, we get every other vertex in $T_{j,k}$.

    Consider the function $f$ that maps from $a$ to $b$ :
    \begin{align*}
     f(a) = b
    \end{align*}

    then the following also holds true for its adjacent vertices :
    \begin{align*}
        f(((m+1)\%j, n)) = (((m+1)+x)\%j, n+y) = (((m+x)+1)\%j, n+y) \\
        f(((m-1)\%j, n)) = (((m-1)+x)\%j, n+y) = (((m+x)-1)\%j, n+y) \\
        f((m, (n+1)\%k)) = (m+x, ((n-1)+y)\%k) = (m+x, ((n+y)-1)\%k) \\
        f((m, (n+1)\%k)) = (m+x, ((n+1)+y)\%k) = (m+x, ((n+y)+1)\%k)
    \end{align*}
    From above, we can see that there is a bijective mapping, which when applied to $a$'s adjacent vertices, gives us $b$'s adjacent vertices. Since b is any vertex in the Torus graph, $T_{j,k}$, we can conclude that for any pair of vertices $a,b \in V_{T_{j,k}}$, there exists an isomorphism $f:T_{j,k} \to T_{j,k}$ such that $f(a) = b$.
\end{proof}

\begin{question}
    Prove that $T_{3,3}$ is $4$-connected
    \end{question}
\begin{proof}
    We need to show that for all $u,v\hspace{2pt}\epsilon \hspace{2pt}$ $V_G$, there exist four disjoint paths from $u$ to $v$.\\
    From the symmetry in the Isomorphism of the \textit{Torus Graph} shown in the above question, we are left with just\\
    two cases to prove that it is 4-connected.
    \begin{case}
        The two vertices are adjacent to each other.

    In \textbf{Case 1}, the four different colors show the four disjoint paths to reach from vertex 1 to vertex 5.\\
    In \textbf{Case 2}, the four different colors show the four disjoint paths to reach from vertex 1 to vertex 2.\\

    $\therefore \text{From the above two diagrams it is easily observed that in both the cases, we are able to get four different paths that }$
    have no shared vertices (except the ends) from
    \text{source to destination.}\\
    \\This is another way of defining that the \textit{Torus Graph} $T_{3,3}$ is $4$-connected.
\end{proof}
\begin{question}
   Prove that if $j$ and $k$ are multiples of $3$, then there exists a Morphism from $T_{j,k}$ to $T_{3,3}$.
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
    Let $j = 3m$ and $k = 3n$.
    
    Consider the mapping $f$: \\
    \begin{gather*}
        f: T_{3m, 3n} \rightarrow T_{3,3} \\
        f_V((a, b)) = (a \% 3, b \% 3)
    \end{gather*}
    
    For the above mapping to be a Graph Morphism, we need to show that if there is an edge in $T_{3m,3n}$, then there is a corresponding edge in $T_{3,3}$
   
    For example, consider a vertical edge, $E = \{(a,b), ((a+1)\%3m, b) \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} T_{3m, 3n}$
    \begin{gather*}
    f_V((a+1)\%3m, b)) = (((a+1)\%3m)\% 3, b \% 3) \\
    \phantom{xxxxxxxxxx} = ((a+1)\% 3, b \% 3)
    \end{gather*}
    We know that $((a+1)\% 3, b \% 3) \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} T_{3, 3}$
    
    Similarly, we can also show this to be true for any horizontal edge. \\
    \begin{gather*}
     f_V((a, (b+1)\%3n)) = (a \% 3, ((b+1)\%3n)\% 3) \\
    \phantom{xxxxxxxxxxx} = (a \% 3, (b+1)\% 3) 
    \end{gather*}
    We know that $((a+1)\% 3, b \% 3) \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} T_{3, 3}$ and $(a \% 3, (b+1)\%3) \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} T_{3, 3}$
    
    $\implies \text{There exists a morphism from $T_{j,k}$ to $T_{3,3}$}$.
   %

\begin{question}
    Prove that if $j\ge 3$ and $k\ge 3$, then $T_{j,k}$ contains a $T_{3,3}$ topological minor.  Recall that this means there is a subgraph of $T_{j,k}$ that can be transformed into $T_{3,3}$ by contracting paths of degree 2 vertices (i.e. induced paths) into a single edge.
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
    To prove the question, let us first take an example that satisfies the condition for $j\ge3$ and $k\ge3$.\\

    For $T_{4,6}$ to contain a $T_{3,3}$ topological minor, we first have to take a subgraph of $T_{4,6}$. This is done to obtain vertices of degree 2.\\ \\
    For any general $T_{j,k}$, we apply the following three operations to obtain our subgraph:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For $x\ge0$ and $y\ge3$,  \\
        Remove edge between vertices (x,y) and (x+1\%j,y)
        \item For $x\ge3$ and $y\ge0$, \\
        Remove edges between vertices (x,y) and (x,y+1\%k)
        \item Remove all vertices (x,y) for $x\ge3$ and $y\ge3$.
    \end{enumerate}
    This subgraph, $H$ now looks as shown below:

    Now from the subgraph, we obtain the desired minor by contracting paths of degree 2 vertices into a single edge.\\
    This is done by applying the following 2 operations:\\
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Contract Path $P_1$ = $\{(x,2),(x,3)\dots(x,k-1),(x,0)\}$ to the Edge $\{(x,2),(x,0)\}$, for x $\epsilon$ $\{0,1,2\}$
        \item Contract Path $P_2$ = $\{(2,y),(3,y)\dots(j-1,y),(0,y)\}$ to the Edge $\{(2,y),(0,y)\}$, for y $\epsilon$ $\{0,1,2\}$
    \end{enumerate}

    Resulting graph is the Graph $T_{3,3}.$\\

\begin{question}
    Show that $K_2 \times K_2 \cong C_4$.

    In Graph theory, the Cartesian product 
    $G \times H$ of graphs $G$ and $H$ is a graph such that the vertex set
    of $G \times H$ is the Cartesian product $V(G) \times V(H)$; and two vertices $(u,u')$ and $(v,v')$ are adjacent in $G \times H$ if and only if either $u = v$ and $u'$ is adjacent to $v'$ in $H$, or $u' = v'$ and $u$ is adjacent to $v$ in $G$.

      f_E: \{ (a,b), (a,b') \} \rightarrow \{a, a\} = \{a\} \\
      f_E: \{ (a,b), (a',b) \} \rightarrow \{a, a'\} \hspace{2pt}  \epsilon \hspace{2pt} E_A
    \end{gather*}
    
    To show that $A$ is a minor of $A \times B$, we need to show that firstly, the mapping above is surjective and secondly, that the pre-images are connected.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The mapping is surjective because under the mapping $f_V$, there are $|V_B|$ pre-images for every vertex $a \hspace{2pt} \epsilon  \hspace{2pt}A$.
        \item If we take the pre-image of any vertex $a \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} A$, then we get the set
    $\{ (a,b) \hspace{2pt}|\hspace{2pt} b \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} V_B \}$. From the definition of the Cartesian product and the fact that $B$ is connected, we can conclude that the pre-image is also connected.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{question}
    Show that $C_j \times C_k \cong T_{j,k}$
\end{question}

\begin{proof}
Consider the cycles
\begin{align*}
C_j = (\{0, 1, .. j-1 \}, \{(m, {(m+1)\%j})\hspace{2pt} | \hspace{2pt} m \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} \{ 0, 1, ... j-1 \} \}) \\
C_k = (\{ 0, 1, ... k-1 \}, \{(n, {(n+1)\%k})\hspace{2pt} | \hspace{2pt} n \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} \{ 0, 1, ... k-1 \} \})
\end{align*}
In $C_j \times C_k$, we have from the definition of Cartesian product that,
\begin{align*}
\{(m,n), ((m+1)\%j, n)\} \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} E_{C_j \times C_k}\\
\{(m,n), (m, (n+1)\%k)\} \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} E_{C_j \times C_k}
\end{align*}
\begin{center}
where $m \hspace{2pt} \epsilon \hspace{2pt} \{ 0, 1, ... j-1 \}$ and  $n \epsilon \{ 0, 1, ... k-1 \}$
\end{center}
For example, consider Graphs $C_3$ and $C_4$. Their Cartesian product is shown below\\

\begin{center}

\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw,circle,minimum size=7mm}]

\draw   (a3) to[out=170,in=10] (d3);
\draw   (a2) to[out=170,in=10] (d2);
\draw   (a1) to[out=170,in=10] (d1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\captionof{figure}{\text{$C_3$ and $C_4$ gives $C_3$ X $C_4$}}
\end{center}
$\therefore$ Every vertex in $C_j \times C_k$ is connected to its four neighbours in a cyclic fashion which is nothing but the Torus graph $T_{j,k}$.
\end{proof}



\section{Euler Walks}
For all of the questions below, let $G$ be a graph with exactly four vertices $a,b,c,d$ of odd degree.
Let $W$ be the edges of a walk from $a$ to $b$ that does not repeat any edges.\\

\begin{question}
    Prove that $c$ and $d$ are connected even if we remove the edges of $W$.  That is, $c$ and $d$ are connected in $G' = G\setminus W\setminus \{v \hspace{4pt} \epsilon \hspace{4pt} (G\setminus W)\hspace{2pt} |\hspace{2pt} deg(v) = 0\}$.

\end{question}
\begin{proof}
    The walk $W$ from $a$ to $b$ does not repeat any edges. In Graph $G'$, we remove the edges from G, which are part of the Walk and any isolated vertices that are left after removing it.\\
    \\
    Also, for any vertex other than $a$ and $b$, when you enter the vertex you also have to leave it.\\
    $\implies \text{In $G'$, parity of all the degree of vertices remains the same, except the source and destination vertices.}$\\
    \\ To summarise :
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Parity of degree of vertices $a$ and $b$ changes from odd to even.\\
        \item Parity of degree of vertices of $c$ and $d$ remains odd.\\
        \item Parity of degree for all other vertices remains even.
    \end{enumerate}
    The Graph $G'$ may now have one or more connected components.\\
    Let us consider two cases depending upon where $c$ and $d$ are located.\\
    \\ \textbf{Case 1.}
        If $c$ and $d$ are part of different (connected)components.\\
        \\
        Let us assume that $c$ and $d$ are in fact not in the same connected component. We prove by contradiction using \textit{Handshake Lemma} that this case is not possible. 
        
        \textbf{Lemma.}  \textit{Handshake Lemma}\\
            Number of vertices of odd degree in a graph is even
        
        
        If one connected component has vertex $c$ but not $d$, this would mean that $c$ is the only vertex of that connected component with odd degree, while all other vertices are of even degree.\\
        \textit{Handshake Lemma} clearly states that this is not possible.\\
        \\
    \textbf{Case 2.}
        If $c$ and $d$ are part of the same (connected)component.\\
        \\
        In this case, $c$ and $d$ are the only odd degree vertices of the component, while all other vertices have even degree.\\
        By \textbf{Euler's Theorem}, there exists \text{ an Euler Walk from $c$ to $d$.}
        \\
        $\implies \text{$c$ and $d$ are connected.}$
    

    $\therefore \text{Only Case 2 is possible.\\ Vertices $c$ and $d$ are connected.}$
\end{proof}
\pagebreak
\begin{question}
    Suppose that $W$ is the longest such walk and that $G$ is connected.  Prove that in this case, $G'$ is connected.
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
    Let us take Graph G as the following\\
\begin{center}

\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw,circle,minimum size=7mm}]

\node (v) at (0,0) {v};

\node (d) at (1,2) {d};

\node (b) at (1,4) {b};

\node (u) at (0,6) {u};

\node (c) at (-1,2) {c};

\node (a) at (-1,4) {a};

\draw[thick] (u) -- (a) ;
\draw[thick] (c) -- (a) ;
\draw[thick] (b) -- (d) ;
\draw[thick] (c) -- (v);
\draw[thick] (v) -- (d) ;
\draw[thick] (b) -- (u);
\draw[thick] (b) -- (a);

\draw[thick] (c) -- (d);
\end{tikzpicture}
\captionof{figure}{Graph $G$}
\end{center}
    The longest walk, $W$ from $a$ to $b$ can be denoted by the sequence of vertices ($a$,$b$,$u$,$a$,$c$,$v$,$d$,$b$).\\
    \\
    $G' = G\setminus W\setminus \{v \hspace{4pt} \epsilon \hspace{4pt} (G\setminus W)\hspace{2pt} |\hspace{2pt} deg(v) = 0\}$\\
    \\
    $\implies \text{G' = \{\{c,d\},(c,d)\}}$
\begin{center}

\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={draw,circle,minimum size=7mm}]

\node (d) at (1,2) {d};
\node (c) at (-1,2) {c};

\draw[thick] (c) -- (d);

\end{tikzpicture}
\captionof{figure}{Graph $G'$}
\end{center}

    Every time, we do this operation of removing the longest walk, we will get only one connected component.\\
    This is true because let us suppose after removing walk $W$ from $G$, we got more than 1 connected component.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item First component would have both vertices $c$ and $d$ together. This was shown in the previous question using the \textit{Handshake Lemma}.
    \item Second, or any other, component would have all vertices with even degree.\\
    By \textbf{Euler's Theorem}, we know that a connected Graph with all even degree vertices has an \textit{Euler Tour.} This is contradiction to the fact that we've chosen the longest walk. We could've added the Euler Tour to the existing walk and gotten an even longer walk.
    \end{enumerate}

    $\implies \text{There is only one connected component in $G'$ and therefore, $G'$ is a connected Graph.}$\\
    \\
\end{proof}
\pagebreak
\begin{question}
    Prove that if $G$ is connected, then there is a pair of walk that don’t repeat any edges, don’t have any edges in common, and together, touch every edge of $G$.
\end{question}
\begin{proof}
    It follows from the previous question that if $G$ is connected and we take the longest walk W from $a$ to $b$, then Graph $G'$ is still connected.
    \\ \\
    Again, by \textbf{Euler Theorem}, a connected graph with all even degree vertices except two vertices (source and destination) as odd degree vertices, has an \textit{Euler Walk} from the source to destination. Let this be denoted by W2.
    \\ \\
    $\implies \text{In Graph $G'$, as only $c$ and $d$ vertices have odd degree, while all other vertices have even degree, there exists an}$ \\ \textit{Euler walk} \text{from $c$ to $d$.}
    
    $\therefore \text{Walks W and W2 don't repeat any edges, don't have any edges in common, and together, touch every edge of Graph $G$.}$
\end{proof}
